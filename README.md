# portfolio v4

	-	Dev Ed: React Router Tut: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Law7wfdg_ls
	-	from SimpleTut https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nusgoj74a3Y
	-	does not account for gulp v4

## Notes

	-	why no {component} import from react anymore? Just function with return,
	No render in app.js.
		-	this is for function comps... for these you'll need usestate and useeffect... for now I'll just use class components with compdidmount!!!

### /public

	-	manifest.json is for pwas and behavior
	-	robots.txt is for web crawlers?
	-	everything else in public
